# Catch-me-if-you-can-Turtlesim-
It is a learning project based on turtlesim. In this four turtles are spawned in a single node, one(Controlled by you using keyboard) follows the other and if it catches you. GAME OVER!!

# Features:
1. It is a simple game, in which four turtles from different direction will come try to reach you, what you have to do is that using turtlesim teleop node   keyboard commands you have to move your turtle, so all those turtles are not able to catch you.

2. But if they reach within range  0.1 of your distance then that that turtle will stop following you.
        
3. The main purpose of this project was to make everybody understand how the tf works in turtlesim.
